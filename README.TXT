This is an example of a peer to peer program in Python. The peers just send random messages to each other in a determined interval, and if one disconnects, the others keep on sending messages between them.

You have to put the hosts ip addresses in the hosts.txt file.

This project idea belongs to Elias P. Duarte Jr. (http://www.inf.ufpr.br/elias/). Implementation was made by me and Diego Roessle
